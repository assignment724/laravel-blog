to run the application, clone the repo, install vendor packages and node nodules.
For node modules do npm install
once done, run php artisan serve and open another terminal and ensure you are in the correct directory before running npm run dev,
i have uploaded the compiled asset files so you will just run php artisan serve again after pulling latest changes
